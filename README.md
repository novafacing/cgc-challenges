# CGC Challenges

There are a couple other repos for the CGC binaries, notably [cb-multios](https://github.com/trailofbits/cb-multios) from Trail of Bits (which this is based on).

They all have weird build system hacks going on that make it
pretty hard to tune your build. This one doesn't!

## To Do:

* Enable multibin challenges
* Fix broken challenges
